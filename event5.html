          A few months ago, Hubert Humphrey became the primary candidate for the
          democratic party. Hubert Humphrey, the former vice president of Lyndon

          Things heated up, when 10,000 protesters came to persuade the
          democratic party into picking a more antiwar candidate. According to
          Chicago's mayor, Richard J Daley, "as long as I am mayor... there will
          be law and order." Delay mobilzied over 5,000 National Guard members,
          and 12,000 police officers.

          In the convention hall, they were debating over an antiwar plank, when
          they heard of the nearby riot going on and what happened. When
          delegates heard of this, they started shouting at Daley, who was a
          delegate himself. The whole world was also watching the convention
          hall on their TV, and now everyone sees the disorder the democratic
          party is capable of.
