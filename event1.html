          The American people have split into two camps: the doves and the
          hawks. The doves say America should withdraw from the the war, and the
          hawks say that we just need to try even harder. The doves and the
          hawks both have strong opinions on the matter. How will this
          difference in beliefs affect the nation?

          The doves, which consist of mainly young people, are taking part in
          many protests and marches, in places including Washington DC, college
          campuses, aswell as talking about it in the newspaper. Some people are
          even burning their draft cards in disguise for the war and the
          "manipulative draft". The doves value love and peace, and believe that
          the war is morally wrong, and has no solid reason to even happen,
          since it's another country's civil war.

          The hawks, consisting mainly of older people, have the opposite
          stance, and want Johnson to put even more force in the Vietnam War.
          They believe that letting communist countries have their way is a
          serious risk, and that America should stop this by any means
          necessary. They believe that the doves are hippies that are weak, and
          aren't willing to do what needs to be done to stop the spread of
          communism throughout the world.

          One study, conducted this month, says that 70% of people still agree
          with the government's decision to stay in the war, and think that the
          protects are "acts of disloyalty"
