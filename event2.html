          On May 4th, a protest against the invasion of Cambodia at Kent State
          University turned voilent and burned down the ROTC building at the
          university. Because of this violence, the local mayor brought the
          National Guard. Things turned even uglier, and the protesters threw
          rocks at them, and the National Guard responded by shooting the crowd.
          Nine People were wounded, and four were killed in the incident.

          While this may seem like a very rare scenario, it happened again in
          Jackson State in Mississippi, a mostly all block college. On May 14th,
          a similarly violent protest occured, and the National Guard showed up,
          and they fired aswell, after bottles were thrown at them. Twelve
          people were injuired, and two more people died. Is all this violence
          justifiable? Will this happen again in the future?

          Does this show a trend of growing disagreement about the war? Should
          we start to question whether us participating in the war is the best
          option, or are these college students not thinking about the issue
          clearly? You could argue that the use of violent protests shows that
          they are acting immature, and aren't thinking things through fully.

          Most people seem to support the National Guard. Polls have been
          taking, and the majority of people think that the National Guard was
          justified, and that they "got what they deserved". A rally took place
          supporting the government, and almost 100,000 people attended.
