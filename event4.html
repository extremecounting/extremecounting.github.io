          On March 16th, an American platoon commanded by Lieutenant William
          Calley, Jr. murdered many innocent villagers. The villgers were in a
          small town in the Northern part of South Vietnam, called My Lai.
          Calley's group was in the area to look around for any Vietcong members
          that they could find.

          William Calley was reportedly looking for Vietcong members in My Lai,
          and couldn't find any. Because of this, he had the soldiers round up
          the villagers. Once soldiers rounded up all the villagers and huddled
          them all into a group, the Lieutenant ordered them to "Kill anything
          that breathed", and they opened fire on the group of innocent Southern
          Vietnamese civilians. One man recalls that he "poured about four clips
          into the group"

          Do you think the soldiers under Lieutenant William Calley, Jr. should
          be held responsible? The troops all insisted that they weren't
          responsible because they were just following the Lieutenant's orders,
          do you agree? 25 officers were charged with some responsiblility for
          the event, but William Calley was the only one to be convicted and
          imprisoned.
