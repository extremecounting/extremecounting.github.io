          Nixon delayed in his promise of peace, and made a "final push" against
          North Vietnam. The Thiue regime rejected Henry Kissinger's plan to
          because Northern Vietnamese troops stationed in South Vietnam alarmed
          them. Chances of a deal started to look very slim, so Nixon made one
          last push against North Vietnam. American planes dropped over 100,000
          bombs over the two biggest cities in North Vietnam, Haiphong and Hanoi
          around Christmas. Finally, everyone seemed to be done with war, both
          America and the enemies.

          On January 27th, America signed a "Agreement on Ending the War and
          Restoring Peace in Vietnam". In this deal, troops from North Vietnam
          would stay in South Vietnam, but Nixon promised that he'd react "with
          full force" if North Vietnam broke the agreement. I don't know if
          North Vietnam is to be trusted, but it appears that we are finally
          withdrawing from the war, whether for the better or the worse.

          Because of this, American troops started started heading back home.
          Today, March 29th, the last of the American troops withdrew from
          Vietnam and headed home. We are officially no longer part of the
          Vietnam War! Most people seem to be in favor of this, as this is
          offically the longest war in U.S. history.
